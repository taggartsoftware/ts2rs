### Issues
Generating binding is hard. Not everything will be able to be mapped. wasm-bindgen makes it easy to add additional manual bindings. Rust make it easy to adapt the types with traits. Please log bugs and other issues on GitHub [issues](https://github.com/taggartsoftware/ts2rs/issues) or email support@ctaggart.com.
